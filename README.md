# Payroll Hour Sorter

### Andrew Kohn

## About
Personal program to sort staff in payroll reports between multiple facilities.

## How to use
https://pdfbox.apache.org/download.html
This project is currently using ver 2.0.26 of pdfbox.
- Download
- Add to project structure
- If browsing this repository,
  - ensure dummy files are within the /Input folder.
- If using, 
  - double-check the payroll start date in the reports.
  - contact me if rTasks changes report format.
- Run from IDE.

Files within the /Input folder will be read, so it is not necessary to rename the report.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Only works with rTasks' generated reports.  This program will not run with any other PDF file.
