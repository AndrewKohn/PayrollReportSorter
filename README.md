## About
A personal program to sort staff's time-clocks in payroll reports between multiple facilities.

## How to use
<div align="center">This project is currently using ver 2.0.26 of pdfbox.</div>
<div align="center"><a href="https://pdfbox.apache.org/download.html">Link to download</a></div>

* Download
* Add to project structure
* If browsing this repository,
  * ensure dummy files are within the /Input folder.
* If using, 
  * double-check the payroll start date in the reports.
  * contact me if rTasks changes report format.
* Run from IDE.

PDF files within the /Input folder will be read, so it is not necessary to rename the report.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Only works with rTasks' generated reports.  This program will not run with any other PDF file.
